            Our Middle School bridges the journey from childhood to adolescence
            with a well-rounded curriculum that encourages critical thinking,
            independence, and collaboration. Students explore deeper concepts in
            science, math, literature, and the arts while building essential
            life skills. Leadership programs, clubs, and hands-on projects
            prepare them for high school and beyond.
